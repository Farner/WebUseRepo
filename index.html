          <h2>Our Vision</h2>
          <p><img src="img/BILDE_VISJON_2.jpg" alt="Mountains" class="float-image-V"> Here, at Laurent Saison, we believe that the quiet elegance of the mountains belongs to everyone—
              not just those with private chalets, monogrammed luggage, or a family tree older than the Matterhorn. We’re here to make old-money charm feel less like an exclusive club,
              and more like a feeling you can step into—calm, confident, and beautifully put-together.</p>

          <p>To us, great style isn’t about wealth.
              It’s about intention. <img src="img/BILDE_VISJON_1.jpg" alt="Mountains" class="float-image-H">
              It’s about choosing pieces that make you feel grounded, capable, and subtly refined,
              whether you’re walking into a café or watching the first snowfall settle on the peaks.<br><br>
              Our inspiration comes from nature: the clean lines of fresh snow,
              the warmth of wood and wool,
              the timeless dignity of alpine living.<br><br>
              
              We want to bring that feeling to everyone—
              no trust fund required.
              Just a love for the outdoors, an appreciation for craftsmanship,
              and the desire to look effortlessly elegant.</p>

          <h3>Welcome to Laurent Saison.</h3>

          <p>Where style feels natural. <br><br>Where luxury feels honest. <br><br>Where the mountains feel like home.</p>

          <h3>Our Classic Jean Project</h3>

          <p>We craft jeans with intention.
              Clean lines.
              Quiet confidence.
              Pieces that feel effortless—
              yet unmistakably refined.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the stillness of the mountains
              and the dignity of timeless style,
              our jeans are made to elevate the everyday.</p>

          <p>Not loud.
              Not indulgent.
              Just honest craftsmanship.
              Natural textures.
              A silhouette that respects the body
              and the landscape.</p>

          <p>We design for people who value simplicity.
              For those who want to feel composed,
              comfortable,
              and quietly elegant—
              without needing wealth to express it.</p>

          <p>This is our vision, woven into every thread:
              Luxury that feels grounded.
              Style that feels natural.
              Clothing that lets you breathe.</p>

          <p>The beginning of something timeless.</p>
